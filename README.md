# DeepLearningRegression
i have created deep learning model for Regression problem . i have used wine quality dataset from kaggle 
i did simple preprocessing .
ABOUT DATASET
Context
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

i got more than 90% r2_score in Random Forset regressot and got more than 93% in nural network .
